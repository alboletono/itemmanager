Not really created to be used at the beginning, one of my many unuseful project that can interest developpers.

This project basically allows you to manage books of your collection and grabbing them from imdb.
The most interesting thing is that it has been coded to be configured by XML and properties files.
For example, adding a new field to describe your book is just an entry in an XML file.

In this little application, all is item and most things can be done without coding.

It is totally experimental and will certainly evolve with time...
